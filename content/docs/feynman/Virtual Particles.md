# Virtual Particles

Previously, we saw how the transfer of photons from one electron to another explains the repulsion when they come close.

But we still haven’t answered the question: When the electron is created released form the first electron, the conservation of energy is violated. How do we account for this?

## Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle



The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the more precisely the time of a particle is determined, the less precisely the energy can be determined. It is given by: $dE \cdot dt \geq \frac{h}{4 \pi}$.

 

This means that small amounts of energy can be created out of nowhere, as long as it disappears fast enough. Similarly, particles can appear out of nowhere as long as they disappear fast enough. These particles are called **virtual particles**.



As such, the photon that is transferred from one electron to the other is **virtual**. In fact, any interactions in Quantum Electrodynamics can be explain by the interactions of virtual particles.

This also explains why electrons repel more at closer distances. At closer distances, the virtual photon requires less time to travel from one electron to the next. As such, the amount of energy that can be “created out of nowhere” is more, and more momentum can be transferred from one electron to the other.



## Infinite Possibilities 

As simple as the idea of a virtual particle is, this leads to quite a complication. Since the particles are virtual, there’s no way to observe them.

Let’s look back at the repulsion of electron again. The transfer of one virtual photon is the simplest case of their interaction. However, we can’t say for sure that’s what is truly happening! What if we transfer two photons instead of one?

There’s countless other possibilities that can explain this interaction, and there’s no way to know which is which. In fact, the truth is an “average” of all the infinite possibilities. 

How do we resolve the infinite possibilities? The answer lies in Feynman Diagrams (link to Feynman Diagram)





### A brief note

This is not the complete description of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, and there's more to it that just this. We're only describing parts of it for you to understand how virtual particles works. 



In fact, there is a another form of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle that relates momentum and displacement. You can watch more [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8FTr2qMutA)
