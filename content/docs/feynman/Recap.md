# Recap

You should be familiar with subatomic particles, antimatter, and classical electrodynamics. But here's a recap of these topics before we move on into quantum electrodynamics and feynmann diagrams.

## Subatomic Particles

To think about quantum interactions, you should ideally be aware of our current understanding of the elementary particles that make up our universe â€“ They are shown in the diagram below.

You might be curious as to what protons and neutrons are made up of. Protons have two up quarks and one down quark, while neutrons have one up quark and two down quarks. This means that most of our observable universe can be described using just up quarks, down quarks and electrons!

We also know of four possible forces, three of which are known to be carried by certain bosons: 

| **Force**      | Strong          | Electromagnetic                    | Weak                | Gravity                     |
| -------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Carried by** | Gluons          | Photons                            | Z bosons / W bosons | Graviton (not yet observed) |
| **Acts on**    | Quarks & Gluons | Quarks, charged leptons & W bosons | Quarks & Leptons    | All                         |

What then, is the Higgs boson? It is an elementary particle that is associated with the mass of every particle (!) and we sometimes see it in Feynman diagrams involving the weak force, or nuclear fusion or nuclear fission where mass is converted into energy, or vice versa. 

## Classical electrodynamics

Electrodynamics or Electromagnetism is the study of Electromagnetic Force. The Electromagnetic force is one of the fundamental forces in our universe, and it studies the interaction between electrically charged particles.

We know that the electromagnetic force is carried by the electric and magnetic fields. Electric Fields and Magnetic Fields assert a force on a charged particle. For example, the magnetic field of a magnet is traced out by the iron filings

This is an electric field. The lines describe the force exerted on the a positively charged particle. We can see that positive charges are attracted to the negative charge, and repelled away from the positive charge.

The idea of electric fields and magnetic fields work well for most day to day interactions. However, for really small objects, like electrons and photons, the classical model of fields begins to break down. We need to take into account quantum mechanics.  Read more here (insert link to QED page)
