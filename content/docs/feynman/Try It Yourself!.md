## Pair production

Did you know that particles can pop out of nowhere? Sometimes, the energy from photons can be converted to the formation of an electron and an positron, and this is known as pair production.

The equation of the interaction is:
$$
\gamma \to e^- + e^+
$$
The $\gamma$ refers to photon, and it uses it's energy to form an electron and a positron.

Try to draw the Feynman Diagram for this interaction!

Remember the electron-positron annihilation from earlier? This process is the reverse of that.
