## **FEYNMAN DIAGRAMS** **(ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE**) 

Interactions involving these fermions and bosons can be graphically described using Feynman diagrams. Let’s start by looking at an interaction between an electron and a photon.

In this diagram, the y-axis represents time and the x-axis represents space. The electron first starts on the left, and moves to the right. At the vertex (connection between the black and blue squiggly lines), the electron and a photon happen to be at the same point in space at the same time. After the electron encounters the photon, the photon disappears and the electron ends up moving to the left. This interaction can be described as an electron absorbing a photon. 

One of the fascinating things about Feynman diagrams is that if you construct a Feynman diagram for a particular particle interaction, you can duplicate, rotate, flip and combine it to predict other particle interactions! For example, the above diagram can be manipulated to form the diagram below.

Here, the electron starts on the left, while the positron starts on the right. They move towards each other, until a mysterious interaction happens in the middle, they are annihilated, and two photons are created. Mathematically speaking, this interaction is explained by the electron on the left moving forward in time, then releasing a photon and somehow moving to the right, then releasing another photon and moving backwards in time. (All anti-particles moving forward in time are mathematically the same as their normal counterparts moving backward in time, even if this may not be physically true, which is why their arrows are reversed.) This interaction can be described as an electron-positron annihilation. 

This is one of the four interactions between electrons, positrons and photons predicted and shown below. Try physically interpreting each one!

Here, we are able to represent the ‘repulsion’ between two charged particles, or the electromagnetic force! In this diagram, one electron exchanges a photon with another, causing them to be shoved off in opposite directions. This is also known as Moller scattering.

## **FEYNMAN DIAGRAMS** **(STRONG & WEAK FORCE)** 

We have thus far seen electromagnetic interactions. But how does it compare to the strong and weak forces?

![electrons repelling each other, with 2 photons](/images/comparison-of-forces.png)

These are the primitive vertices for the strong, electromagnetic and weak forces. How about gravity? Well, there are no diagrams for gravity because gravitons haven’t been observed (yet). 

We will dive in deeper into Feynman diagrams, but eventually, we must support our intuition with laws that exist. Most importantly, each vertex in a Feynman diagram must conserve charge, baryon number and lepton number. 

The conservation of charge is quite logical. For instance, an up quark has a charge of +2/3, while a down quark has a charge of –1/3. This is also why neutrons, having one up quark and two down quarks is neutral, while protons, having one two up quarks and one down quark has a charge of +1. If a neutron decays into a proton, a W- boson must be spit out to conserve charge. 

Baryons are massive particles which are made up of three quarks in the standard model. Each baryon is giving a baryon number of 1. By logic, quarks are given a baryon number of 1/3. An antiquark is given a baryon number of –1/3. This is why mesons, made up of a quark and antiquark, are given a baryon number of 0. No known decay process or interaction in nature changes the net baryon number. 

All leptons are given a lepton number of 1, while all anti-leptons are given a lepton number of –1. For example, an electron and anti-neutrino will balance each other out, and that’s why they appear in the beta decay of an atom.

How about the weak nuclear force?
