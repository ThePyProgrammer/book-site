Here, we prepared a recap of these topics to refresh your memory (or lay out some essential fundamental concepts) before we move on into quantum electrodynamics and Feynman diagrams.\nSubatomic Particles and Forces #  The Standard Model #  To explore quantum interactions, you should know have an awareness of our current understanding of the elementary particles that make up our universe. We all know that everything around us is made up of atoms - small blobs constantly in motion: flying around, bumping into one another, etc. - which are supposedly, indivisible building blocks of our world. Modern physics has taught us, however, that is not quite true; we can still cut these atoms up further and further (even protons and neutrons!) into what are termed elementary particles – which are really indivisible (to our knowledge). They are shown in the diagram below, which is called the Standard Model of Particle Physics.\nYou might be curious then: what are protons and neutrons made up of? The answer is quarks. Protons have two up quarks and one down quark (denoted $uud$), while neutrons have one up quark and two down quarks ($udd$). This means that most of our observable universe can be described using just up quarks, down quarks and electrons! (electrons are already elementary particles, so we can\u0026rsquo;t divide them further)\nThe Four Fundamental Forces #  We also know that all forces we experience are a consequence of four fundamental forces. Usually, we explain how these forces act at a range using the concept of a field. But at a quantum scale, we realise that these fields can be explained using particles too! Of the four, three are known to be mediated by certain bosons. For the last force, gravity, scientists hypothesise that it is also mediated by a boson, called the graviton, but the theory has yet to be supported by empirical observation.\n   Force Strong Electromagnetic Weak Gravity     Carried by Gluons Photons $Z$ bosons / $W$ bosons Graviton (?)   Acts on Quarks \u0026amp; Gluons Quarks, charged leptons \u0026amp; $W$ bosons Quarks \u0026amp; Leptons All    What about the Higgs boson? #  You may have heard about the hype surrounding its confirmation by CERN and Atlas in 2013. While we won\u0026rsquo;t cover it in depth (you can read more about it here and here), it is an elementary particle that is associated with the mass of every particle (!) and we sometimes see it in Feynman diagrams involving the weak force, or nuclear fusion or nuclear fission where mass is converted into energy, or vice versa. It was theorised to explain what seemed like inconsistencies in the electroweak unification theory (which says that the electromagnetic and weak force can be explained by a single electroweak force), i.e. photons being massless while $Z$ and $W$ bosons having ~$100$ times greater mass than protons.\nClassical electrodynamics #  Electrodynamics or Electromagnetism is the study of Electromagnetic Force, which explains the interaction between electrically charged particles.\nWe know that the electromagnetic force is carried by the electric and magnetic fields. Electric Fields and Magnetic Fields exert a force on a charged particle. For example, the magnetic field of a magnet can arrange iron filings like so:\nMagnetic Field\nElectric Field\nThis is an electric field. The lines describe the force exerted on the a positively charged particle. We can see that positive charges are attracted to the negative charge, and repelled away from the positive charge.\nThe idea of electric fields and magnetic fields works well for most day to day interactions. However, for really small objects, like electrons and photons, the classical model of fields begins to break down. Hence, we need another explanation - quantum mechanics. Read more in the QED section.\n"});index.add({'id':1,'href':'/quantum-electrodynamics/','title':"Quantum Electrodynamics",'section':"Feynman Diagrams",'content':"Quantum electrodynamics #  Combining the ideas of Quantum and Classical Electrodynamics, we have quantum electrodynamics. In essence, Quantum electrodynamics explains the phenomena of electric fields and magnetic fields in terms of the discrete interactions of charged particles and photons.\nA word on momentum transfer #  Newton\u0026rsquo;s 2nd Law states that force is the rate of change of momentum ($\\vec p$), or $\\vec F = \\frac{d\\vec p}{dt}$. Hence, for an object to exert a force on another, it must transfer momentum, given by $\\vec p = m \\vec v$. A law governing this transfer is the Law of Conservation of (Linear) Momentum: for a system, its momentum must be the same before and after a process has occurred.\nFor example, this phenomena manifests when firing a gun. As the bullet flies forwards, the gun will recoil backwards. Why so? Initially, nothing is moving, so the momentum of the system is $0$. Thus, after firing, the momentums must cancel out to $0$. This is only possible if the gun have an equal momentum to the bullet, but in the opposite direction. This explains why a gun recoils backwards when a bullet is fired forwards. (Note that this means that when firing a bullet, a force is applied backwards on the gun as well)\nIn quantum electrodynamics, this concept applies as well. We will see that soon enough in the following sections.\nExplaining why electrons repel #  We know that like charges repel. Hence, two electrons, being both negatively charged, will repel when they are close to one another. The classical explanation is that an electric force is exerted due to the presence of an electric field. But how do we explain this in the quantum view? Is momentum somehow related to this?\nYes! In fact, we can reuse our gun firing analogy. Imagine an electron is a gun. When it \u0026ldquo;fires\u0026rdquo; a photon (the bullet), it \u0026ldquo;recoils\u0026rdquo;. Thus, the trajectory of the electron changes. Because the photon carries momentum to the right, and the electron must gain some momentum leftwards to cancel out this initially non-existent rightwards momentum. Hence, it is deflected towards the left.\nNow, instead of emitting a photon, what if an electron is hit by a photon? The photon transfers its momentum to the electron. In this case, the electron absorbs the photon. The rightward momentum of the photon is transferred to the left-moving electron, deflecting it towards the right.\nNow, here comes the magic. Try combining the two halves together. What do you notice?\nThis is actually the repulsion of two electrons!\nWhen two electrons move close together, they can exchange photons*. These photons transfer momentum from one electron to another, causing them to repel.\nThis illustrates a fundamental concept of quantum electrodynamics: electric forces are mediated by the transfer of momentum by photons.\n*Stop To Think! #  Something seems strange here, doesn\u0026rsquo;t it? Why can photons be exchanged? When the photon is created out of nowhere, isn\u0026rsquo;t the law of conservation of energy violated? See more in Virtual Particles!\n"});index.add({'id':2,'href':'/virtual-particles/','title':"Virtual Particles",'section':"Feynman Diagrams",'content':"Virtual Particles #  Previously, we saw how the transfer of photons between electrons explains why they repel one another when close together.\nBut we still haven’t resolved the issue that conservation of energy seems to have been violated. How do we account for this?\nHeisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP) #  The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the more precisely the time of a particle is determined, the less precisely the energy can be determined. Mathematically, the product of uncertainties regarding those two values cannot be smaller than some constant. We express this as $$ \\Delta E \\cdot \\Delta t \\geq \\frac{h}{4 \\pi} $$ These uncertainty values mean that we can \u0026ldquo;create\u0026rdquo; small amounts of energy out of nowhere for a very tiny period of time. Hence, particles (being a manifestation of energy) can \u0026ldquo;appear\u0026rdquo; seemingly out of nowhere as long as they disappear fast enough. We call such particles virtual particles.\nIn our earlier examples, the photon that is transferred between electrons is a virtual particle. In fact, any interactions in Quantum Electrodynamics can be explained by the interactions of virtual particles. They don\u0026rsquo;t really exist in our usual sense, so our law of conservation of energy is pretty safe for now.\nInterestingly, virtual particles also explains why electrons repel more at closer distances. At closer distances, the virtual photon requires less time to travel from one electron to the next. The time period where we are uncertain about what is going on is shorter, so the amount of energy that can be “created out of nowhere” is greater. This implies that more momentum can be transferred from one electron to the other.\nInfinite Possibilities #  While the idea of a virtual particle is simple, it isn\u0026rsquo;t without issues. Since the particles don\u0026rsquo;t exist in the usual sense, we don\u0026rsquo;t have a way to observe them.\nLet’s examine the repulsion of electron again. The transfer of one virtual photon is the simplest case of their interaction. However, we can’t say for sure that’s what is truly happening! Why can\u0026rsquo;t two photons be transfered instead of one?\nIn fact, there’s countless other possibilities that can explain this interaction. None of them is sufficient to describe what actually happens. The truth lies in the “average” of all the infinite possibilities.\nHow do we deal with these infinites then? The answer lies in Feynman Diagrams.\nA remark about HUP #  This is only an elementary description of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle to explain how virtual particles works. In fact, what we have stated may be an uncommon statement of the principle, which may have been a source of confusion if you have read about it earlier. The more common form of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates momentum and displacement instead. You can watch more about it here.\n"});index.add({'id':3,'href':'/feynman-diagrams/','title':"Feynman Diagrams",'section':"Feynman Diagrams",'content':"FEYNMAN DIAGRAMS (ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE) #  Interactions involving these fermions and bosons can be graphically described using Feynman diagrams. Let’s start by looking at an interaction between an electron and a photon.\nIn this diagram, the y-axis represents time and the x-axis represents space. The electron first starts on the left, and moves to the right. At the vertex (connection between the black and blue squiggly lines), the electron and a photon happen to be at the same point in space at the same time. After the electron encounters the photon, the photon disappears and the electron ends up moving to the left. This interaction can be described as an electron absorbing a photon.\nOne of the fascinating things about Feynman diagrams is that if you construct a Feynman diagram for a particular particle interaction, you can duplicate, rotate, flip and combine it to predict other particle interactions! For example, the above diagram can be manipulated to form the diagram below.\nHere, the electron starts on the left, while the positron starts on the right. They move towards each other, until a mysterious interaction happens in the middle, they are annihilated, and two photons are created. Mathematically speaking, this interaction is explained by the electron on the left moving forward in time, then releasing a photon and somehow moving to the right, then releasing another photon and moving backwards in time. (All anti-particles moving forward in time are mathematically the same as their normal counterparts moving backward in time, even if this may not be physically true, which is why their arrows are reversed.) This interaction can be described as an electron-positron annihilation.\nThis is one of the four interactions between electrons, positrons and photons predicted and shown below. Try physically interpreting each one!\nChallenge: Try to create a Feynman diagram using two vertices to predict the ‘repulsion’ of two electrons.\n Expand ↕  Here, we are able to represent the ‘repulsion’ between two charged particles, or the electromagnetic force! In this diagram, one electron exchanges a photon with another, causing them to be shoved off in opposite directions. This is also known as Moller scattering.\n   FEYNMAN DIAGRAMS (STRONG \u0026amp; WEAK FORCE) #  We have thus far seen electromagnetic interactions. But how does it compare to the strong and weak forces?\nThese are the primitive vertices for the strong, electromagnetic and weak forces. How about gravity? Well, there are no diagrams for gravity because gravitons haven’t been observed (yet).\nWe will dive in deeper into Feynman diagrams, but eventually, we must support our intuition with laws that exist. Most importantly, each vertex in a Feynman diagram must conserve charge, baryon number and lepton number.\nThe conservation of charge is quite logical. For instance, an up quark has a charge of $+\\frac{2}{3}$, while a down quark has a charge of $-\\frac{1}{3}$. This is also why neutrons, having one up quark and two down quarks is neutral, while protons, having one two up quarks and one down quark has a charge of $+1$. If a neutron decays into a proton, a $W^-$ boson must be spit out to conserve charge.\nBaryons are massive particles which are made up of three quarks in the standard model. Each baryon is giving a baryon number of $1$. By logic, quarks are given a baryon number of $\\frac{1}{3}$. An antiquark is given a baryon number of $-\\frac{1}{3}$. This is why mesons, made up of a quark and antiquark, are given a baryon number of $0$. No known decay process or interaction in nature changes the net baryon number.\nAll leptons are given a lepton number of $1$, while all anti-leptons are given a lepton number of $-1$. For example, an electron and anti-neutrino will balance each other out, and that’s why they appear in the beta decay of an atom.\n[strong nuclear forces diagrams]\nHow about the weak nuclear force?\n"});index.add({'id':4,'href':'/applications/','title':"Applications",'section':"Feynman Diagrams",'content':"Applications of Feynman Diagrams #  Significance of Feynman Diagrams #  With its simplicity and elegance, the Feynman Diagram has been applied liberally in particle physics explanations. Using just a bunch of lines and squiggly lines, Feynman was able to explain and solve problems involving subatomic particle interactions easily. His diagrams are brilliant illustrations that allowed us to predict other particle interactions after constructing a single example.\nBut it hasn\u0026rsquo;t always been this way. When the first Feynman diagram was published, few physicists believed that it was a rigorous answer to the perplexing inconsistencies when dealing with \u0026ldquo;Self-Energy\u0026rdquo;. Yet while Schwinger and Tomonaga\u0026rsquo;s mathematical explanations were impressive, they were too complex to be applied effectively when we need to analyse more complicated interactions between more particles.\nThe first Feynmann Diagram published in 1949\nFortunately, Dyson showed later in a classic paper that the 3 brilliant scientists' methods were equivalent. And for their work, they received the joint Nobel Prize in Physics for 1965.\nCommon applications #  Radioactive Decay #  $\\beta^-$ decay #  In $\\beta^-$ decay, we have a neutron spontaneously converting into a proton, an electron and an anti-neutrino. This can also be written as:\n$$ n \\to p^+ + e^- + \\overline{v} $$ This can be represented using a Feynman diagram too! Let\u0026rsquo;s take a look (note that the vertical axis is space, while the horizontal is time):\nWait, but what\u0026rsquo;s $d$, $u$, $W^-$ and so on? Let\u0026rsquo;s summarise it in the following table:\n   Symbol Name Description     $d$ Down quark Makes up matter   $u$ Up quark Makes up matter   $W^-$ W boson Particle mediating weak forces    It may seem a bit strange, but recall that a neutron consists of 1 up quark and 2 down quarks, while a proton consists of 2 up quarks and 1 down quark. Thus, by converting a down quark to an up quark, a neutron can become a proton!\nWith that out of the way, let\u0026rsquo;s look at the diagram more closely. The top two solid lines represent the conversion of a down quark to an up quark, that\u0026rsquo;s easy. Since we have a change in the flavour of quarks, we know that the weak force is involved here. Thus, we must have a $W$ boson acting as the middle-man. By applying conservation of charge on the top vertex, we can determine that it must have a charge of $-1$.\nNow, the second vertex is where things start to get more interesting. When we learned $\\beta^-$ decay, many of us probably wondered why an anti-neutrino is produced. It seemed very arbitrary, but here we see a rather nice explanation. According to the rules of Feynman diagrams, we must have a real particle entering and exiting each vertex. So far, we only have a real particle exiting ($e^-$), because the $W^-$ boson is virtual and doesn\u0026rsquo;t count. Thus, there must be another particle that is entering! We draw another line, but this time, we have to direct it backwards in time to satisfy that condition, which tells us that this particle is an antiparticle. That\u0026rsquo;s how we predict the existence of the anti-neutrino, and scientists have confirmed that through experiments.\nFundamental applications #  Exchange forces, again #  As mentioned in the previous sections, forces that we usually think of being due to a certain field can be explained using particle physics too! Here\u0026rsquo;s a quick recap:\n   Fundamental Force Mediator     Weak Force W and Z boson   Strong Force Gluon   Electromagnetic Photon   Gravity Graviton*    *not confirmed yet, but this is the current scientific consensus\nDo you remember what the forces we usually experience fall under?\n See answer ↕  Electromagnetic forces! Normal force and friction are macro-level observations of repulsions between the charged particles of different atoms when you try to squish them close together.    To illustrate how these particles mediate these forces, let\u0026rsquo;s look at a few examples (in fact, the nuclear decay explanation above is an instance of weak force in action).\nA pair of electrons, EM Force and Weak Force #  What happens when two electrons collide into one another?\nWell, they\u0026rsquo;ll repel each other and fly apart, because like charges repel right? Usually, that is indeed what happens when we have a virtual photon mediating the EM force between the two, which we see in the following Feynman diagram:\nHowever, there is also another possible cause of this repulsion, albeit less common. That is, the $Z$ boson could have been a mediator for a weak interaction between the electrons. Note that the $Z$ boson and not the $W$ boson is involved, because we have a neutral intermediate due to the conservation laws of particle interactions.\n“Worked examples” of interactions with explanations #  [optional] DIY Exercises with answers for self-check #  References #    https://physics.aps.org/story/v24/st3\n  http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Particles/feyn.html\n  "});index.add({'id':5,'href':'/try-it-yourself/','title':"Try It Yourself!",'section':"Feynman Diagrams",'content':"Try It Yourself! #  Here are some other interesting quantum phenomenea, try to draw the Feynman Diagram for each one of them!\nPair production #  Did you know that particles can pop out of nowhere?
