But here&amp;rsquo;s a recap of these topics before we move on into quantum electrodynamics and feynmann diagrams.
Subatomic Particles # To think about quantum interactions, you should ideally be aware of our current understanding of the elementary particles that make up our universe – They are shown in the diagram below.
You might be curious as to what protons and neutrons are made up of.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://l-yc.github.io/physics-website/docs/feynman/quantum-electrodynamics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://l-yc.github.io/physics-website/docs/feynman/quantum-electrodynamics/</guid><description>Quantum electrodynamics # Combining the ideas of Quantum and Classical Electrodynamics, we have quantum electrodynamics. In essence, Quantum electrodynamics explains the phenomena of electric fields and magnetic fields in terms of the discrete interactions of charged particles and photons.
Transferring Momentum # Force is the change in momentum over the change in time, or $F = \frac{dp}{dt}$. As such, this means that for an object to assert a force on another, it must transfer momentum somehow.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://l-yc.github.io/physics-website/docs/feynman/feynman-diagrams/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://l-yc.github.io/physics-website/docs/feynman/feynman-diagrams/</guid><description>FEYNMAN DIAGRAMS (ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE) # Interactions involving these fermions and bosons can be graphically described using Feynman diagrams. Let’s start by looking at an interaction between an electron and a photon.
In this diagram, the y-axis represents time and the x-axis represents space. The electron first starts on the left, and moves to the right. At the vertex (connection between the black and blue squiggly lines), the electron and a photon happen to be at the same point in space at the same time.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://l-yc.github.io/physics-website/docs/feynman/virtual-particles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://l-yc.github.io/physics-website/docs/feynman/virtual-particles/</guid><description>Virtual Particles # Previously, we saw how the transfer of photons from one electron to another explains the repulsion when they come close.
But we still haven’t answered the question: When the electron is created released form the first electron, the conservation of energy is violated. How do we account for this?
Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle # The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the more precisely the time of a particle is determined, the less precisely the energy can be determined.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://l-yc.github.io/physics-website/docs/feynman/applications/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://l-yc.github.io/physics-website/docs/feynman/applications/</guid><description>Applications of Feynman Diagrams # Significance of Feynman Diagrams # With its simplicity and elegance, the Feynman Diagram has been applied liberally in particle physics explanations. Using just a bunch of lines and squiggly lines, Feynman was able to explain and solve problems involving subatomic particle interactions easily. His diagrams are brilliant illustrations that allowed us to predict other particle interactions after constructing a single example.
But it hasn&amp;rsquo;t always been this way.</description></item></channel></rss>
