Using just a bunch of lines and squiggly lines, Feynman was able to explain and solve problems involving subatomic particle interactions easily. His diagrams are brilliant illustrations that allowed us to predict other particle interactions after constructing a single example.
But it hasn&amp;rsquo;t always been this way.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://l-yc.github.io/physics-website/docs/feynman/quantum-electrodynamics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://l-yc.github.io/physics-website/docs/feynman/quantum-electrodynamics/</guid><description>Quantum electrodynamics # Combining the ideas of Quantum and Classical Electrodynamics, we have quantum electrodynamics. In essence, Quantum electrodynamics explains the phenomena of electric fields and magnetic fields in terms of the discrete interactions of charged particles and photons.
Transferring Momentum # Force is the change in momentum over the change in time, or $F = \frac{dp}{dt}$. As such, this means that for an object to assert a force on another, it must transfer momentum somehow.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://l-yc.github.io/physics-website/docs/feynman/recap/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://l-yc.github.io/physics-website/docs/feynman/recap/</guid><description>Recap # You should be familiar with subatomic particles, antimatter, and classical electrodynamics. But here&amp;rsquo;s a recap of these topics before we move on into quantum electrodynamics and feynmann diagrams.
Subatomic Particles and Antimatter

Classical electrodynamics
Electrodynamics or Electromagnetism is the study of Electromagnetic Force. The Electromagnetic force is one of the fundamental forces in our universe, and it studies the interaction between electrically charged particles.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://l-yc.github.io/physics-website/docs/feynman/virtual-particles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://l-yc.github.io/physics-website/docs/feynman/virtual-particles/</guid><description>Virtual Particles # Previously, we saw how the transfer of photons from one electron to another explains the repulsion when they come close.
But we still havenâ€™t answered the question: When the electron is created released form the first electron, the conservation of energy is violated. How do we account for this?
Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle # The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the more precisely the time of a particle is determined, the less precisely the energy can be determined.</description></item></channel></rss>
